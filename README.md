``NOW SUPPORTS CONTRACT ADDRESS AS A CURRENCY INPUT``


Since the scraper has support for multiple exchanges (running pancakeswap.finance frontend), arguments can be used to specify pair that should be tracked, different exchange url as well as alias that will be showed in the db instead of the url:

``--c1`` -> currency1, type: str, default: BNB

``--c2`` -> currency2, type: str, default: BUSD

``--ex`` -> target_exchange, type: str, default: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap

``--exalias`` -> exchange_alias, type: str, default: PANCAKESWAP

``--reverse`` -> reverse, type: bool, default: False - allows you to reverse pair and get selling price

``--path`` -> bin_path, type: str, default: "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" - allows you to specify path to chrome driver if not available within default location
